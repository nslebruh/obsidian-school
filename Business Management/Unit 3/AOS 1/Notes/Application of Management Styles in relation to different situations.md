# Application of Management Styles


### Nature of the task
How difficult or complex a task is and how quickly decisions need to be made
For example, a simple task that needs quick and fast decisions is more suited to an Autocratic management style whereas a complex task may be better suited to a Consultative or Participative management style

### Time
The existence of a deadline and how far away that deadline is
For example, an Autocratic management style is more suited when a deadline is fast-approaching, but a Laissez-faire management style is better suited when when there is not a deadline

### Employee Experience
How well the employees understand their fields and how efficient said employees are
For example, the Autocratic management style is better suited when employees are inexperienced whereas the Participative or Consultative management style can work better when employees are skilled and knowledgeable 

### Manager Preference
The personal preferences of the manager (Skills, values and beliefs, experience)
