- Fairytales are generally told to children and contain a moral message and magical elements
- Fairytales and subtly different to magical realism because they are generally simpler as they usually have a single protagonist, contain magic and have a happy ending
- Examples include:

	- Nicola and Charlotte surviving the fire
	- Levi appears to gain a new life purpose
