Folklore is traditional beliefs and legends

- Several of the stories have hints of folklore - traditional beliefs and legends
- For example, in Salt, the connection between the tuna hunters and the seals
- Transformed animals are classic characters in folklore and Allen's transition from human to Cormorant reflects this.
