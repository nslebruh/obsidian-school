### Waves

It must have been at least 6 months since I'd seen him without that weight looming over him. Since I'd seen him smile and seen joy in his eyes. Since he came back, half the man he once was.

When I met Karl I knew he had a mistress. He never tried to hide that from me. He saw her almost every day. She was his first love. Part of his very being. Connected to him in ways I could never be. She enticed him with her salty scent and welcomed him with her strong salt-watery embrace and her rhythmic waves.  I should have been resentful of it, but I could never bring myself to. It had always been a part of him, much before I was. It made him happy and complete, and who would I be to take that away from him. The sea filled a need that I never could.

I'd never known a Karl that wasn't a Oneblood fisherman, that wasn't entirely committed to his craft, or that wasn't at one with the sea. He had always been more at home in the ocean than on land, it ran in his veins, almost an extension of his very being. And even then, I'd only ever been out to sea with him once in his dinghy. And that was to meet his seal.  He spent more time with the seal than with any other living being. It was his partner, his companion. They were like a sheep dog and a farmer working in unison, in sync - like a well oiled machine. No words needed. They understood each other completely. They had absolute trust in each other and shared a deep emotional bond. I knew this meeting was extremely important to Karl.

The discomforting bobbing of the dinghy didn't bother Karl in the slightest. I could feel my hair whipping around my face and my eyes sting from the saltwater spray. The cool ocean air dried my lips, but was invigorating. Karl took no notice of any of it. I saw him pick up his spear and ready himself and scanned the water around him. I couldn't see anything but the steely choppy waves. The dinghy lurched suddenly to one side as a brown seal settled its body over the boat's edge. It's fur glistened in the sunlight and water droplets ran off it's rippling body. I could sense that it wasn't comfortable with me being in the boat. As it stared at me it seemed to be trying to see if I was a threat. I was feeling quite anxious and hesitant and I could see that Karl knew this when he asked me to reach for the seal. I closed my eyes and reached my hand out. I felt it's warm, fishy breath on my skin. I opened my eyes to find it's black eyes staring back at me. It's deep stare was unwavering, as if it could see right into my soul. Karl motioned for me to use both my hands to cup its face. Despite its power and strength, I could feel a gentleness beneath the surface, a calmness, and at that moment I knew the seal had accepted me. This was all Karl had wanted.

Days turned into weeks, and weeks turned into months, and still, Karl wasn't himself. He would sit on the beach, staring out to the horizon, not seeing a thing, only hearing the haunting clicks of the orcas. He could only see life as it used to be, and what he had lost and that things could never be the same. He couldn't bring himself to go out and bond with another seal. The seal was his other half and he was a broken man, a man without purpose, unanchored and adrift. It was as if a part of him died that day. His grief was like the ebbs and flow of the tides, it came in waves. Sometimes like a tidal wave, engulfing him completely, and sometimes it was just a ripple. Sometimes it would sit below the surface like an undercurrent, like the orcas circling under the surface threatening to attack without warning. It would leave him feeling exhausted and empty, but thankfully over the recent weeks the frequency and intensity were becoming less. Nicola would be visiting in a few weeks with Levi who was also lost and adrift. She had suggested that he and Levi may be able to help each other move forward. Maybe connecting with someone will enable  him to have some semblance of purpose, and might even help them heal.    




he was lost at sea without a compass.
- imagery about meeting seal - senses - wind in hair, saltwater spray, smell of seal, 
- how important it was for Karl to get approval from seal 
- Strength of seal - describe body, build, reassuring 
- Karl's affinity with nature 
- enjoyed the thrill of the hunt, came alive
- Karl would come home exhausted but with a sense of fulfilment 
- how brutal and cruel the sea can be 
- Talk about seal
	- Relationship / bond with seal 
	- Liken to sheepdog and farmer (from interview) - worked in unison
	- Unspoken language - communication in sync - trust and loyalty till end
	- "Found the other half he was born without"
	- Mutual respect for both seal and sea
 
Grief like wading through quicksand / wet sand

He was immersed in sorrow.
Feels lost and disconnected from his roots. 

Cannot go fishing or connect with another seal - heart isn't in it anymore
