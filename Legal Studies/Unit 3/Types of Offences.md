# Types of Offences

## Summary Offences
Summary offences are less serious crimes that are heard in the Magistrates' Court. The Magistrate decides the verdict and the sanction of the case without a jury. The summary process is shorter than cases in higher courts. Examples include offensive behaviour and drinking offences


## Indictable Offences
Indictable offences are more serious offences that are heard in higher courts such as the County or Supreme court. Unlike the Magistrates' Court, a jury decides the verdict and the judge decides the sanction. Some less serious offences can be heard summarily by a magistrate, such as theft. Example include murder
