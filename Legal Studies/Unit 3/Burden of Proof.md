# Burden of Proof

The burden of proof is the responsibility to prove the facts of the case. The burden of proof rests with the initiators of the case. In a criminal case, the prosecution holds the burden of proof, meaning that they must prove that the accused person is guilty. This in term means that the accused does not have to prove their innocence.
