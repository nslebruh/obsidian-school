# Purposes of committal proceedings

The purpose of committal proceedings is to decide if there is sufficient evidence to support a conviction in addition to finding out how the accused pleads (guilty or not guilty). Committal proceedings also serve as the place where it is decided whether it is appropriate to hear the charges summarily and to ensure that there will be a fair trial by allowing the accused to prepare their case.
