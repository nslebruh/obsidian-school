# Jury

An accused person has a right to a trail by jury if they plead not guilty to an indictable offence
Criminal juries have 12 people that are chosen randomly from voter lists
Jurors must:
	be objective, unbiased, impartial and unconnected with the case
	Listen to and remember evidence
	Listen to the direction of the judge about the law
	Discuss and make a decision on the facts about a case to reach a verdict of guilty or not guilty

The verdict should be unanimous but can be a majority verdict (all but one) except in murder, treason and serious drug cases
