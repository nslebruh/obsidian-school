# Burden of Proof

The burden of proof is the responsibility to prove the facts of the case. The burden of proof rests with the initiators of the case. In a criminal case, the prosecution holds the burden of proof, meaning that they must prove that the accused person is guilty. This in term means that the accused does not have to prove their innocence.


# Principles of Justice

## Equality:
- People are treated equally by the court regardless of age, gender, religion, ethnicity, sexuality, disability, etc..
- People can present their case without advantage or disadvantage

## Access:
- People should understand and be informed of their legal right
- people can pursue and present their case
- this often requires access to legal representation (lawyers)

# Rights of the Accused

- The right to be tried without unreasonable delay

## The right to be tried without unreasonable delay
It is stated by the Human Rights Charter that a person that has been charged with a criminal offence is entitled, without discrimination, to a guarantee that said person will be tried without unreasonable delay. The right recognises that there may be a delay in the case, but that delay must not be unreasonable. The term ‘unreasonable delay’ is not defined, but the reasonableness of any delay will depend on factors such as the complexity of the case and the legal issues involved. For example, it would be reasonable for the prosecution to need more time to prepare for a case involving multiple crime scenes, multiple crimes and multiple accused people with few or no witnesses, as opposed to a case where there was a single incident with multiple witnesses. This right is supported by Section 21(5) of the Human Rights Charter, which states that a person who is arrested or detained on a criminal charge has the right to be brought to trial without unreasonable delay. This is because, under the Charter, people have a basic right to liberty and security, and accused persons are presumed innocent until proven guilty. Therefore, people should not be held for an unreasonable amount of time while they are awaiting trial.

## The right to a fair hearing 
The Human Rights Charter entitles a person charged with a criminal offence to have the charge decided by a competent, independent and impartial court after a fair and public hearing. There are two parts to this right:
1. A competent, independent and impartial court must decide the proceeding or charge. That means, for example, that every person has the right to have their case heard by a qualified and experienced judge or magistrate in an unbiased and objective manner. 
2. A hearing must be fair, and public. Most court hearings are open to the public. This ensures that the trial and trial processes are transparent and not hidden in secrecy. If criminal cases were conducted in secret, there would be no way for the public to know whether laws are applied properly and processes are fair. An open courtroom allows for public and media scrutiny of processes. In some circumstances a court may exclude members of media organisations or the general public from all or part of a hearing. For example, the Magistrates’ Court has the power to make an order that proceedings are closed to the public if they will cause undue distress or embarrassment to a victim in a sexual offence case.

## The right to trial by jury
A trial by jury is where a person’s peers within the community decide the outcome of the case – i.e. in a criminal case, whether or not the accused is guilty. This right dates back to well before the Magna Carta in England, established in 1215, which said that no free man shall be imprisoned except by lawful judgment of his peers. The jury system provides the opportunity for community participation in the legal process, and for the law to be applied according to community standards. The right to trial by jury is not protected by the Human Rights Charter, but rather protected in part by the Australian Constitution, and in part by statute law in Victoria. Section 80 of the Australian Constitution states that any person who is charged with a Commonwealth indictable offence is entitled to a trial by jury. However, section 80 of the Australian Constitution provides only a limited right to trial by jury, because most indictable offences are crimes under state law, and this section only applies to Commonwealth offences. In addition, the Commonwealth Parliament can determine by statute which offences are ‘indictable’. For Victorian indictable offences, the Criminal Procedure Act 2009 (Vic) requires a jury to be empanelled where the accused pleads not guilty to the indictable offence. There is no right to a jury trial for summary offences. If a jury trial is required (i.e. an accused has pleaded not guilty to an indictable offence), then the Juries Act 2000 (Vic) sets out the requirements in relation to the composition and responsibilities of the jury. A criminal jury is made up of 12 jurors. The jury will hear the case and will need to reach a verdict on whether the accused is guilty or not guilty. The jurors must make a decision beyond reasonable doubt.


# Standard of Proof

The standard of proof refers to the strength of the evidence needed to prove the case. In a criminal case, the standard of proof is *beyond reasonable doubt*, and as such, the prosecution must prove to the jury or magistrate that the accused is guilty *beyond reasonable doubt*. 


# The Presumption of Innocence

The presumption of innocence ensures that any person that is accused of a crime is presumed to be innocent until they have either admitted guilt or pleaded guilty, or been found guilty by a jury or a magistrate.


# Types of Offences

## Summary Offences
Summary offences are less serious crimes that are heard in the Magistrates' Court. The Magistrate decides the verdict and the sanction of the case without a jury. The summary process is shorter than cases in higher courts. Examples include offensive behaviour and drinking offences


## Indictable Offences
Indictable offences are more serious offences that are heard in higher courts such as the County or Supreme court. Unlike the Magistrates' Court, a jury decides the verdict and the judge decides the sanction. Some less serious offences can be heard summarily by a magistrate, such as theft. Example include murder

# 3.3 Textbook Questions

Q1. Provide two differences between summary offences and indictable offences.
	Summary offences differ from indictable offences in that a summary offence is considered to be an offence of lesser impact and is heard by a magistrate in the Magistrates Court whereas an indictable offence is considered to be of a higher impact than a summary offence and is heard by a judge in either a County or Supreme Court.

Q2. Who has the burden of proof in a criminal case? What is the reason for this?
	In a criminal case, the burden of proof falls on the prosecution. the reason for this is the idea of the 'presumption of innocence'. The presumption of innocence ensures that any accused person is presumed to be innocent of any crimes they are accused of. Due to this, the accused person does not have to provide evidence and / or prove their innocence, and as such, the burden of proving the guilt of the accused falls to the prosecution.

Q3. Define the term ‘the presumption of innocence’ and explain three ways it is upheld in a criminal case.
	The term "Presumption of innocence" refers to the idea that in a court of law, anyone who is accused of a crime is presumed to be innocent of the crime until said person has been proven guilty of the crime. In a criminal case, the "Presumption of innocence" is upheld in three ways, including the burden of proof falling on the prosecution, the setting of bail, and the high standard and scrutiny of proposed evidence and the case as a whole.
