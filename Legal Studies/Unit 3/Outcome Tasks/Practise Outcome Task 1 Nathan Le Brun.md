Simon is correct in his belief that he, as an accused person, is entitled to a trial by jury.

Assuming that Andrew is not a minor, and / or cognitively impaired, he is not eligible to give evidence by way of a recording as stated by the Criminal Procedures Act. Although not eligible to give evidence by recording, Andrew still has other options available to him such as giving evidence through a 'closed-circuit' television system or having the accused hidden from view. 

###### 6. Simon wants a quick trial that is closed to the public. Explain whether he would be entitled to both of these rights under the Human Rights Charter.
In regards to a quick trial, Simon is entitled to a trial without unreasonable delay under the Human Rights Charter, but this does not ensure that the court proceedings will be quick. In addition to this, the Human Rights Charter also provides the accused with the right to a fair and public trial. Due to the nature of the case, Simon may be eligible to request that his case be closed to the public.  

###### 7. Explain whether there are rights available to Sally and Judith to give evidence in a way that alleviates their concerns.

###### 8. Discuss the extent to which you believe the principle of access has been achieved so far in this case.
The principle of access outlines that any persons should be able to understand and / or be informed of their legal rights, as well as be able to pursue and present their case. In regards to this case, access has been achieved to a moderate degree. Access had been achieved as seen through Simon, who understood his rights as an accused persons, and was able to afford legal representation. Access was not achieved in regards to the Sally, Judith and Andrew.
