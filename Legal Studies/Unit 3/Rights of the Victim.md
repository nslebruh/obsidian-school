# Rights of the Victim

In a criminal case, three rights are provided to the victims. These include:
- Right to give evidence as a vulnerable witness
- Right to be informed about the proceedings
- Right to be informed of the likely release date of the accused

### TLDR:
|                  Right                   | Description | Main source of right |
|:----------------------------------------:|:----------- |:-------------------- |
| To give evidence as a vulnerable witness | Certain victims who are witnesses may be entitled to be considered vulnerable and therefore able to give evidence by alternative means.            | Various provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act                     |
|   To be informed about the proceedings   | Victims are entitled to be informed at reasonable intervals about the progress of an investigation into a criminal case (unless they do not want that information, or that information may jeopardise the investigation). Once a prosecution has commenced, victims should be informed about the charges, hearing dates and times, outcomes, sentences and details of any appeal.            | Sections 7, 8 and 9 of the Victims’ Charter                     |
|     To be informed of the likely release date of the accused                                     | If a person is a victim of a criminal act of violence and are on the Victims Register, they may receive information about the likely release date of the imprisoned offender.            | Section 17 of the Victims’ Charter                     |


## Right to give evidence as a vulnerable witness
In some criminal cases, a victim may be a witness in the criminal case. If so, they will have to give evidence in support of the prosecution’s case against the accused. A number of sections in the Criminal Procedure Act aim to protect vulnerable witnesses. The term ‘vulnerable witness’ is not defined in the Criminal Procedure Act or in other statutes. However, children, people who suffer from a cognitive impairment, and people who have been a victim of sexual offences and domestic violence generally fall within the category of vulnerable witnesses. These people are particularly at risk if they give evidence: because of their circumstances they may feel uncomfortable or distressed, embarrassed or intimidated (and, as a result, their evidence may be jeopardised), or they may suffer secondary trauma as a result of having to describe what happened. The laws therefore provide some protections to them for when they give evidence. The main protection available under the Criminal Procedure Act for vulnerable witnesses is for alternative arrangements to be put in place when the witness gives evidence. These alternative arrangements are described below. Alternative arrangements The court can direct alternative arrangements to be made for a witness to give evidence in criminal proceedings for: 
- a sexual offence 
- a family violence offence
- an offence for obscene, indecent, threatening language or behaviour in public
- an offence for sexual exposure in a public place. 
Types of alternative arrangements include: 
- the witness may give evidence from a place other than the courtroom by means of closed-circuit television (or other like facilities)
- screens may be used to remove the accused from the direct line of vision of the witness
- a support person may be chosen by the witness to be there while giving evidence
- only certain persons may be allowed in court when the witness is giving evidence
- legal practitioners may be required not to be formally dressed in robes, or may be required to be seated while asking the witness questions. 
The purpose of these arrangements is to ensure that the witness is protected from unnecessary contact with the accused, and is not placed in a position where they are scared or give unreliable evidence because of the trauma they suffer in doing so. This is particularly so in cases involving charges for sexual offences and family violence, where the trauma and injuries sustained may be significant.

## Right to be informed about the proceedings
The Victims’ Charter recognises that persons adversely affected by crime are entitled to certain information about the proceeding and about the criminal justice system. The Victims’ Charter requires investigatory agencies, prosecuting agencies and victims’ services agencies (which includes police officers, the DPP and the Victims of Crime Commissioner) to provide clear, timely and consistent information about support services, possible compensation entitlements and the legal assistance available to persons adversely affected by crime. In addition, the Victims’ Charter requires an investigatory agency (a body which conducts a criminal investigation, such as Victoria Police) to inform a victim, at reasonable intervals, about the progress of an investigation into a criminal offence. The information does not need to be given if it may jeopardise the investigation, or if the victim chooses not to receive that information. Once a prosecution has commenced, the Victims’ Charter requires the prosecution to give a victim the following information: • details of the offences charged against the person • if no offence is charged, the reason why • how the victim can find out the date, time and place of the hearing of the charges • the outcome of the criminal proceeding, including any sentence imposed • details of any appeal. The victim must also be told that they are entitled to attend any court hearings. These requirements recognise that victims may wish to be kept informed about a criminal case that has affected them. They will often want to know what offences the accused has been charged with, the verdict, and the sanction imposed, as they want to see justice done.

## Right to be informed of the likely release date of the accused

A person who is registered on the Victims Register may receive certain information about an offender who has been imprisoned, including their likely date of release, and (if applicable) their release on parole. The information must be provided at least 14 days before the release of the prisoner. The offender’s release date is likely to be of interest to a victim who has suffered violence from that person. Other rights are also available to a victim on the Victims Register, including the right to know the length of the sentence, the right to be told if the offender escapes from prison, and the right to make a submission if the imprisoned offender may be released on parole.
