- Standard deviation is a measure of how spread out a set of data is
- It is calculated by taking the square root of the variance
- The formula for calculating the standard deviation is: 
- $s=\sqrt{[\sum(x-\mu)2/(n-1)]}$
- The standard deviation is used to measure the amount of variability or dispersion in a set of data
- A low standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be close to the mean of the data set, while a high standard deviation indicates that the data points are spread out over a wider range of values
- The standard deviation is a commonly used measure of variability in statistics and probability theory
