• Normal distribution is a continuous probability distribution that is symmetric about the mean, showing that data near the mean are more frequent in occurrence than data far from the mean. 
• It is also known as the Gaussian distribution or bell curve. 
• The probability density function (PDF) of a normal distribution is given by: 
$$f(x)=\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$$
where $\mu$ is the mean and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation. 
• The normal distribution is used in many fields, such as statistics, engineering, finance, and economics. It is also used to model real-world phenomena, such as heights and test scores. 
• The normal distribution is important because it is often used to approximate the distribution of a population when the population size is large and the population is normally distributed. 
• The normal distribution is also used to calculate confidence intervals and to make inferences about the population.
