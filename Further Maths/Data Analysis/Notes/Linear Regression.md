# Linear Regression



• Linear regression is a statistical model used to describe the relationship between a dependent variable (Y) and one or more independent variables (X).

• The linear regression model is expressed as: 
$$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \epsilon$$

• $\beta_0$ is the intercept, $\beta_1$ is the slope of the line, and $\epsilon$ is the error term. 

• The goal of linear regression is to estimate the values of $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ so that the line best fits the data. 

• The best-fit line is found by minimizing the sum of squared errors (SSE). 

• The coefficient of determination (R-squared) is used to measure the goodness-of-fit of the model.
