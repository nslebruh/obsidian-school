# Residuals

• Residuals are the differences between the observed values and the predicted values of a regression model. 

• The residuals are calculated by subtracting the predicted value from the observed value: 

$$residual = observed - predicted$$

• Residuals can be used to assess the performance of a model by examining the residuals’ distribution and magnitude. 

• If the residuals are randomly distributed around zero, the model is said to be a good fit. 

• If the residuals are not randomly distributed, the model may need to be adjusted or a different model may need to be used. 

• Residuals can also be used to identify outliers, which are data points that are significantly different from the rest of the data.
