#### Standardised scores

$$
\begin{matrix}
z=\frac{x-\bar{x}}{s} \\
where\space x:score \\
\bar{x}:mean\space score \\
s: standard\space deviation
\end{matrix}
$$



1. $\textbf{Standardised scores}$: a type of score that is calculated by subtracting the mean from an individual score and then dividing by the standard deviation

2. $\textbf{Z-score}$: the most common type of standardised score, calculated by subtracting the population mean from an individual score and then dividing by the population standard deviation

3. $\textbf{T-score}$: a type of standardised score, calculated by subtracting the population mean from an individual score and then dividing by the population standard error

4. $\textbf{Standard Error of Measurement (SEM)}$: a measure of the precision of a test, calculated by dividing the standard deviation of the scores by the square root of the sample size

5. $\textbf{Standardised scores}$ can be used to compare scores across different tests or to compare scores of different individuals on the same test.
