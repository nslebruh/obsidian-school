• Mean (or average) is a measure of central tendency, which is calculated by adding up all the values in a set of data and dividing by the number of values: 

$$\text{Mean} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}{n}$$

• The mean is the most common measure of central tendency and is useful for describing the general behaviour of a set of data. 

• It is important to note that the mean is sensitive to outliers and can be distorted by extreme values.
