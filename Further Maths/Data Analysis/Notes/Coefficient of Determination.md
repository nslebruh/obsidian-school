# Coefficient of Determination



• The Coefficient of Determination ($R^2$) is a measure of the proportion of the variability in the response variable that is explained by the explanatory variables in a regression model. 

• $R^2$ is equal to the square of the Pearson correlation coefficient $r^2$ between the observed and predicted values of the response variable.

• $R^2$ is calculated as the ratio of the explained variation to the total variation, expressed as a percentage: 

$$R^2 = \frac{\sum (\hat{y} - \bar{y})^2}{\sum (y - \bar{y})^2}$$

• $R^2$ is always between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates that the model explains none of the variability of the response data around its mean, and 1 indicates that the model explains all the variability of the response data around its mean.
